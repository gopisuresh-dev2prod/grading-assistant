  <h1>Class Performance Insights</h1>
  <div className="analysis-content">
    <h2>Strengths:</h2>
    <div className="analysis-item">
      <strong>1. Understanding of Economic Concepts:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Most students have demonstrated a clear understanding of fundamental economic principles.</li>
        <li>Many students effectively applied these principles to real-world scenarios, showing practical knowledge.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div className="analysis-item">
      <strong>2. Critical Thinking and Insight:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Students like Ethan Clark and Sofia MÃ¼ller exhibited strong critical thinking, providing insightful analysis and strategic recommendations.</li>
        <li>Many responses included considerations of broader market implications and competitive dynamics.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div className="analysis-item">
      <strong>3. Clarity and Organization:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>The majority of the students structured their answers logically and clearly, enhancing readability and comprehension.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>Areas for Improvement:</h2>
    <div className="analysis-item">
      <strong>1. Depth of Economic Analysis:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Several students, including Avery Thompson and Kofi Adebayo, need to deepen their economic analysis by integrating more comprehensive metrics and theories.</li>
        <li>Explicitly mentioning economic models and metrics can demonstrate a deeper understanding.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div className="analysis-item">
      <strong>2. Practical Application and Examples:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Incorporating more real-world examples and case studies could strengthen the arguments and provide practical context.</li>
        <li>Students should consider the inclusion of specific examples to support their points, enhancing the practical relevance of their analysis.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div className="analysis-item">
      <strong>3. Addressing All Parts of Questions:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Some students missed addressing all aspects of the questions comprehensively. Ensuring thorough responses to all parts of a question is crucial for higher scores.</li>
        <li>It's important to cover each part of the question in detail to provide a complete and well-rounded answer.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div className="analysis-item">
      <strong>4. Improving Clarity and Cohesion:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>While most responses were clear, there is room for improvement in terms of conciseness and coherence. Minor grammatical and typographical errors need attention.</li>
        <li>Ensuring that all points are directly relevant to the question and logically connected can improve the overall quality of the answers.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>Recommendations for the Class:</h2>
    <div className="analysis-item">
      <strong>1. Depth of Economic Analysis:</strong>
      <p><strong>Action:</strong> Allocate more class time to in-depth discussions of key economic models and metrics. Ensure that students understand how to apply these concepts practically.</p>
      <p><strong>Effort Focus:</strong> Conduct workshops or practical sessions where students can practice applying economic theories to real-world scenarios. Use case studies from various industries to demonstrate how to integrate these principles into their analyses.</p>
    </div>
    <div className="analysis-item">
      <strong>2. Incorporating Real-World Examples:</strong>
      <p><strong>Action:</strong> Integrate more real-world examples and case studies into lectures. Highlight successful and unsuccessful applications of economic strategies in different industries.</p>
      <p><strong>Effort Focus:</strong> Provide assignments that require students to research and present case studies. This will help them understand the practical implications of theoretical concepts.</p>
    </div>
    <div className="analysis-item">
      <strong>3. Addressing All Parts of Questions:</strong>
      <p><strong>Action:</strong> Emphasize the importance of thoroughly addressing all components of a question. Teach students how to break down complex questions into manageable parts.</p>
      <p><strong>Effort Focus:</strong> Offer detailed feedback on assignments, specifically pointing out any missed components. Conduct review sessions where students can learn how to structure their responses to cover all necessary aspects.</p>
    </div>
    <div className="analysis-item">
      <strong>4. Improving Clarity and Cohesion:</strong>
      <p><strong>Action:</strong> Focus on improving students' writing skills, particularly in organizing and articulating their thoughts clearly.</p>
      <p><strong>Effort Focus:</strong> Incorporate writing workshops into the curriculum where students can practice structuring their answers logically. Provide examples of well-structured responses and highlight common pitfalls to avoid.</p>
    </div>
    <p className="conclusion">By focusing on these areas, the class can improve their overall performance, achieving a deeper understanding and better articulation of economic concepts and their applications.</p>
